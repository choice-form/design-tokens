            <p>
              Subdued color variants provide gentler alternatives to our main
              color scales, designed for contexts where full saturation might
              feel too intense. These variations maintain the essential
              character of each hue while offering improved balance in complex
              interfaces.
            </p>

            <p>
              These variants are particularly effective for large background
              areas, subtle accents, and interfaces that require extended
              viewing periods. They help reduce visual fatigue while preserving
              color meaning and brand consistency.
            </p>
